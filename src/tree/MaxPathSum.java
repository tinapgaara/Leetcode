/*
* Leetcode:
*
* Given a binary tree, find the maximum path sum.

    For this problem, a path is defined as any sequence of nodes from some starting node to any node in the
    tree along the parent-child connections. The path does not need to go through the root.

    For example:
    Given the below binary tree,
        1
      / \
     2   3
     Return 6.
